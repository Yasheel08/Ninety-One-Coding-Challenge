Ninety One Coding Challenge Report- Converting Number to Words

For the function that converts a number to words, I made use of Two arrays- one array stores the single digit and double digit numbers less than Twenty(less than twenty because most of the numbers can be reused from this array if the number is larger than Twenty). the second array stores the numbers at the tens postion and reuse the numbers from the first array when needed. I made use of Two arrays instead of one because this made it a lot easier to do the indexing When an array is called for example in the first array the word for number 1 is at postion one in the array and the word for number 2 is at position 2 etc, same can be done for the second array- Twenty is at position 2 etc. The reason why I included the word Ten in the first array and not the second is because if I did that the indexing for the first array will be incorrect(for example the word eleven will now be at position 10 instead of 11 and so forth for the other numbers).

I explained my code through the comments provided and I made use of mulitple if else statements throughout my program. The algorithm should convert numbers up to tens of billions(11 digits) to words.

One flaw in my program that I was not able to solve was if two numbers had a space between them like in the final example in the test input, I was not able to output that the number is invalid for that number.

I used python as the programming langauge and I created this program using Pycharm and should run properly in this IDE.Please view the input in the input.txt file provided and you may change the input in the file to further test the program if desired.
